        </p>
        <p>
            The MBTI (or Myers-Briggs Type Identifier) was originally based on personality theory developed and proposed by <strong>Carl Jung.</strong> It was proposed by Isabel Briggs Myers and her mother Katharine Briggs, who designed the identifier
            to make understanding Jung's theories easier. It consists of four major <strong>dichotomies,</strong> which are contradictory choices.
        </p>
        <p class="project-header">Extraversion (E) vs Introversion (I)</p>
        <p>
            The E/I distinction refers to which "world" a person enjoys being in, the outer world or the inner world. Whether a person is energized by other people, or by spending time alone, is what makes a person an E or an I.
        </p>
        <p class="project-header">Intuition (N) vs Sensing (S)</p>
        <p>
            The N/S distinction refers to how a person processes information as they recieve it. An S person will simply take information at face value, focusing on the raw input of exactly what they recieve. An N person will interpret information they see, add their
            own meaning to it. That's primarily what makes up the N/S barrier.
        </p>
        <p class="project-header">Feeling (F) vs Thinking (T)</p>
        <p>
            The F/S distinction refers to basic emotions, and whether a person uses emotions (F) in making their decisions, or uses logic (T.)
        </p>
        <p class="project-header">Percieving (P) vs Judging (J)</p>
        <p>
            The P/J distinction refers to how a person interacts with the outside world. A Judgin person prefers to get things "decided," while a percieving, or prospecting person, prefers to take other opinions into account and stay open to new options.
        </p>
        <p class="header">History</p>
        <p>
            Together, those four dichotomoies put together a 4-letter code. The MBTI assessment has been taken by millions of people each year since its inception, and is widely used in industry. Carl Jung proposed the Percieving vs. Judging dichotomy, and talked
            about Introversion vs Extroversion, but Myers and Briggs created the survey in order to quantify Jung's theories in an easy-to-understand manner.
