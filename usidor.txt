I am Sam, Wizard of the 4th, 5th, and 3rd realms of Ephysius; Master of tubes and wires, manipulator of code, explorer of dreams. The musicians know me as Sam the Soloist, the Actors know me as Tumbleweed Tanner. The wizards themselves know me as Safety Sam, and the space engineers know me as Pho Nex, and there may be many other secret names you do not know yet.
