                About Me
            </p>
            <p>
                I am a software engineer attending North Carolina State University in Raleigh, North Carolina. My home town is Wilmington, North Carolina. I am a web developer and I am also passionate about performing arts. I built robots with Team 4534, the Wired Wizards, during my time in high school. I enjoy downhill skiing in the mountains of West Virginia and Canada.
                Some of my favorite entertainment includes video gaming, designing Dungeons and Dragons Campaigns, and watching Star Trek: The Next Generation.

            </p>
            <p>
                This is my personal site. I use it to host web experiments and write about things that interest me. The coding and styling for it was all designed by yours truly. The HTML for this page was generated using CTML, which is my tool for generating clean HTML.
                You can read more about it below. The user interaction with the typing was inspired by Hacker Typer, a popular tool with my robotics friends. If your fingers are still tired by now, and you haven't typed the whole page, you can type 'skip'
                and have it all load.

                    In my senior year, I was the Team Captain and a programmer on FIRST Robotics Competition Team 4534, the Wired Wizards. We have precisely 6 weeks, beginning in January each year, to design, build, program, market, and brand a robot for that year's FRC challenge. We have to
                    raise $30,000 per year. You can read more about this awesomeness over at our website! Click the header above.

                    As mentioned above, I have built a tool for writing the web in a cleaner manner. Called CTML, for Clean Text Markup Language, it is rather slick. You can check it out on my GitHub, which you can access by clicking the header.
